## About the uec-cm-prototype repository

The repository contains code needed to run the capacity management user interface. It was previously held in the uec-cm repository, leveraging existing react set-up before moving to this separate repository.

The UI screens in this repository are designed by the UX team and developed so users can interact with the screens and journey flows during UR sessions.

The code is exploratory and has not been tested.

**User flow**:

Any username besides 'admin' can be entered to see the standard journey flow

**Admin flow**:

Only the 'admin' username will show the admin journey flow

### Hospital Units

Certain hospitals in the mock data have separate units. This is shown 'My Services' page. When these hospitals are selected in the 'My locations' page the user will be directed to the 'My Services' page. Selecting a unit will show the 'Update questionnaire' page.
